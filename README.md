# Employee_Attrition_Prediction

This project aims to predict whether an employee is likely to leave a company (attrition) based on various workplace and personal features using machine learning techniques.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Predicts employee attrition (Yes/No) based on input features.
- Uses structured HR data like job role, satisfaction, income, overtime, etc.
- Data preprocessing and model training included.
- Interactive API using Flask (optional).
- Model and scaler are saved for reuse.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Model training and EDA)
- **Flask** (for optional API endpoint)
- **Joblib** or **Pickle** (for model serialization)
